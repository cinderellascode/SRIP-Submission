## I created Heart Rate Monitoring System which helps to measure accurate pulse rate and send it to mobile app, So anyone can easily see there pulse rate in there mobile phones.
I had used different components like Arduino UNO, NodeMCU ESP8266 Wifi Chip and Heart Rate Pulse Sensor.
# Circuit Diagram goes like this for Heart Rate Monitoring System :
